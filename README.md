### Project Description
The Smart Parking System Website is a web-based solution designed to simplify the process of finding,reserving,and managing parking spots.It offers the real time parking availability,booking fuctionality,and payment integration to help users find and secure parking easily,while parking lot owners can efficiently manage parking spots ,track occupancy ,and optimize usage.

### The Problem statement
Inurban areas ,the demand for parking spaces is continually increasing due to rising vehicle ownership.However the process of finding and managing parking spaces remains inefficient and stressful for both  drivers and parking slot operators.
KEY ISSUES INCLUDE:
*Difficulty in finding Available Parking.
*Inefficient Use of Parking Spaces.
*Lack of Real-Time Information.
*Manual payment and booking process.
*Ineffective parking management.

### The Solution
A smart parking system addresses these challenges by offering an intelligent ,technology -driven solution that benefits both users (drivers) and parking lot operators:
1.Efficient Parking search.
2.Real-Time Parking Sopt Monitoring.
3.Online Reservation and Payment.
4.maximizing parking Lot Usage.
5.Data-Driven insights.
6.Reduction in traffic congestion and pollution.
